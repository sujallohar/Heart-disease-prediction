ðŸ«€ Heart Disease Prediction Model

This project aims to predict the presence of heart disease using real-world healthcare data and machine learning techniques. It includes data preprocessing, visualization, statistical analysis, and implementation of a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier. The goal is to build an accurate and interpretable model that can assist in early diagnosis.

ðŸ“Š Dataset

The dataset includes medical features such as:

Age, Gender
Blood Pressure, Cholesterol Level
BMI, Smoking, Diabetes
Triglyceride, Fasting Blood Sugar, CRP Level, etc.

ðŸ§  Techniques Used

Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classifier
Data Preprocessing (Encoding, Missing Value Handling)
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Model Evaluation (Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, etc.)
